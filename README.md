# Moved to GitLab

Due to the recent circumstances where GitHub has been acquired by Microsoft, 
I have decided to leave this place. There can't be any better time to move 
to an open-source project (at least one where most parts are) rather than 
staying and by that supporting Microsoft to build up yet another monopoly 
based on a closed-source software.

**This repository is now hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/woblight/ActionMirroringFrame)**

We already live in a world almost exclusively controlled by closed software.
I hope as many people as possible will follow, in order to build up a 
new open-source standard of git hosting. I believe that all developers 
(especially open-source developers) should understand this point of view.

I highly appreciate anyone who takes the opportunity and does the same.

See you on GitLab
